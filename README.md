# LazyExifTool
Simple C++ program as I keep forgetting ExifTool comands.

Only sets:
Camera Make
Camera Model
Lens

These are the only settings I currently wish to change as it fixes the scanner data being used with 35mm film scans.

You must have the ExifTool program installed from here: https://exiftool.org/

N.B. If you have stumbled here by accident, please note this is just a simple program to enable my lazyness.
